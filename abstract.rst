Entropy-Based Nuclear Fuel Cycle Sensitivity Analysis
=====================================================
The nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) provides many possible pathways for future electric power generation.
Once class of options is a light water reactor (LWR), fast reactor (FR) symbiotic fuel cycle scenario. This was modeled and
parameterized based on thirty independent inputs (such as FR burnup, reprocessing separation efficiencies, repository 
drift diameter, etc). Individual fuel cycle realizations were attained by stochastically choosing values for each of these inputs.
By executing numerous (100,000+) realizations, the fuel cycle itself underwent Monte Carlo simulation. 

Sensitivities to different inputs or input pairs were determined with respect to various global fuel cycle
metrics (e.g. repository capacity, levelized fuel cycle cost, etc.).  One such response metric which this
fuel cycle framework measures is risk (through proliferation resistance).  Moreover, risk may be simultaneously 
associated with other system responses, such as cost.

As a surrogate for traditional linear, one-dimensional sensitivities, information theoretic measures which do 
not depend on the functional form of the response were used.
The measures that were used include the multidimensional Shannon entropy, mutual information, the uncertainty 
coefficient, and further aggregations of these metrics. 

The entropy-based measures reviewed provide a systematic method for
quantifying these covariances. Knowledge of these and other covariances is important in identifying 
high-leverage fuel cycle design parameters.  
Due to the stochastic nature of of the analysis, a much 
larger fuel cycle option space may be efficiently explored than with previous modeling techniques.
However, the strength of this method is that these sensitivities provide the 
system designer a platform on which to make valid inter-cycle probabilistic risk assessment comparisons and decisions.
